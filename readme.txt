"assignment_1" contains all the resources needed for the coursework submission.

A Makefile is included which can be used to compile the submission for running.

To call the makefile and compile all of the files at once, type "make" or "make all" in the terminal.
Alternatively, you can compile a single program (along with the modules needed for that program) by typing "make (program)" where (program) is the name of the specific module e.g. pgmEcho, pgmComp etc.

To then run a program, type "./(program)" along with any necessary arguments / files to be passed into the program.

To clean any object files, type "make clean" in the terminal.
